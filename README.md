## Starting Template for Sanity Guest Author Tutorial
Hello! This is a boilerplate starter for a tutorial. We'll be building an authenticated todo app using the following tools:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Magic.link](https://magic.link)
- [Sanity](https://sanity.io)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)

The starter has the auth code already implemented c/o [Eric Adamski](https://vercel.com/blog/simple-auth-with-magic-link-and-nextjs).
Just add your the following values to a `.env.local` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_PUB_KEY=pk_test_12345
MAGIC_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_12345
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=random_encryption_string
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_ID=your_sanity_id
SANITY_WRITE_KEY=your_sanity_write_key
```
